# Female SuperVillain Trading Card App (REST API Version)
This is the same Female SuperVillain Trading Card App as the [template version](https://github.com/adriculous/female-supervillain-trading-card-template-ver), except this is the refactored REST API version. It still has the same features as the previous ones, but a lot more efficient and a lot cleaner.

### Features and Skills
- REST API routes and endpoints
- Response status
- Convert data to JSON objects with the Jsonify module
- Create an API directory

### Future Plans
I'll probably use this app as a template for building different types of trading card apps with different themes for practice, such as those related to my current J-Pop (Japanese Pop) fandoms, namely using REST API. When the app does get populated with a lot of data, this version would be the perfect fit.
