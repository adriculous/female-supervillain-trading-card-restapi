# Female SuperVillain Trading Card App (REST API Version)
This is the REST API version of the Female Supervillain Trading Card app. Class project by [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com).

Following features here:
- A gallery of custom-designed interactive trading cards of female supervillains
- Users can add their own custom-designed supervillain card in the database
- Built using Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and custom-built REST API for speed and efficiency

### See it in action!
Check out this [repl](https://repl.it/@adriculous/Female-Supervillain-Trading-Card-REST-API-version) and feel free to play with it.

### Future Plans
I'll probably use this app as a template for building different types of trading card apps with different themes for practice, such as those related to my current J-Pop (Japanese Pop) fandoms, namely using REST API. When the app does get populated with a lot of data, this version would be the perfect fit.
